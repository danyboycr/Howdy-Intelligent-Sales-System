# Howdy Group: Intelligent Sales Simulation & Decision Support System

This project builds an intelligent forecasting, simulation, and recommendation system for Howdy Group — a multi-brand restaurant chain in Pakistan. Using Python, SHAP explainability, and time-aware machine learning models, it delivers brand-specific predictions, compliance tracking, and operational recommendations.
